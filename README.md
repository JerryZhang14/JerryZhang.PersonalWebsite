Hi, My name is Jerry Zhang and this is my personal website. 
Hi, I’m Jerry Zhang. I’m a second-year Electrical Engineering student at the University of British Columbia (UBC).

I am a second-year Electrical Engineering student at the University of British Columbia (UBC). This website serves as a central place to introduce myself and to showcase engineering projects I have worked on, including academic, personal, and exploratory projects.

The site will be updated over time as I develop new projects and gain additional experience.
